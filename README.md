# Doorbit Helm charts library

[![Artifact Hub](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://artifacthub.io/badge/repository/robjuz)](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?repo=robjuz)

This repo is a collection of [Helm](https://helm.sh/) charts for software that I wanted to use and didn't found an existing chart.

## TL;DR

```bash
$ helm repo add doorbit https://doorbit.github.io/helm-charts/
$ helm search repo doorbit
$ helm install my-release doorbit/<chart>
```
